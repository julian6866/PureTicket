<b>Download Tickets</b>

    <p>Tap "Enter Auth Code" and input Auth code. (Use 'SAMPLE' as demo Auth Code). </p>
    <p>
The app will automatically pull down the tickets on the server.
        </p>
<p>
        You should see the total number of tickets is now updated (top right corner, right below the download icon).

<p></p>

<b>Use Sample QR Codes (for demo purpose)</b>
<p>
To scan ticket, you will need some sample valid QR codes. We have prepared them for you.</p>
    <p>
    To make testing easier, please use a <u>separate</u> desktop/laptop computer or phone/table to open the following page so that your mobile phone (Pure Ticket App) can scan the QR codes on the screen:
    </p>
    <p>
    <a href="http://www.pureiconsulting.com/tt">http://www.pureiconsulting.com/tt</a>
</p>
<p>
You may try to scan any QR code, but they will not be recognized as valid ticket.
</p>


<b>Upload Ticket</b>
<p>
    You may manually upload scanned ticket to server so that they will be marked as "used".</p>
<p></p>
    <img src="upload.png" width=50>
    <p>
</p>

<b>Enable Sync with Server</b>
<p>
    You may enable Sync with server so that this app will upload scanned tickets and download & refresh unscanned tickets with server given the frequency you select by sliding the Sync bar.

</p>


<h2>FAQ</h2>
<b>Is Internet connection required to use Pure Ticket?</b>
<p>The Internet connection is required only when initially downloading the tickets from the server. </p>
    <p>It then can work in offline mode.</p>
    <p>
    If you have multiple mobile devices running Pure Ticket app for scanning/validating the same set of tickets (using the same Auth Code), you will need Internet connection to allow mobile devices to synchronize with server at the frequency you set if you wish the devices are all synchronized at the time when tickets are scanned.</p>
